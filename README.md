## Overview of DiagConfig
![](.assist/DiagConfigOverview.png)

*DiagConfig* is a white-box configuration diagnosis system and is general enough to adapt to software systems under different configurations, workloads, and environments. It consists of two parts: 1) *offline analysis*, and 2) *online diagnosis*. 

- *Offline analysis* identifies performance-sensitive options by revealing the dependencies between options and performance-related operations. 
This procedure requires two inputs: 1) the target systemâ€™s source code, and 2) a list of specific prerequisites. The prerequisites contain statements that load configuration option values (as sources) and performance-related operations (as sinks) in the source code. 
 It builds information-flow paths from option values to performance-related operations via taint tracking, extracts options' static performance properties, and then classifies performance-sensitive options and information-flow paths. 
 
- *Online diagnosis* continuously monitors system runtime behavior, locates performance-violating hotspot functions, and collects call-chains for the performance-violating hotspot functions from the profiling. It builds cause-effect chains with information-flow paths and call-chains, which further reveals the data- or control-flow dependency between individual options and performance-violating hotspot functions.
When a new performance violation occurs, *DiagConfig* can apply these cause-effect chains to guide diagnosis and to recommend crucial configuration options for performance tuning.
It can work as a daemon process that continuously analyzes performance-violating configuration options for auto-tuning.

## How to use DiagConfig
### Offline analysis
#### Taint Tracking
We utilizes the [FlowDroid](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid) to support configuration options taint tracking. 
By treating configuration loading statements as *sources* and performance-related operations as *sinks*, it reveals the direct data dependency between the options and the operations. But the if/switch-related and loop-related control dependencies are missed out. Therefore, we slightly modified the sink manager component of FlowDroid with program-dependence graphs for our purposes 
to mark *if/switch* statements with branches containing performance-related operations and *loop* startup/jump-out statements with body containing performance-related operations as *expanded sinks*. Then, if the conditions of if/switch statements or loop startup/jump-out statements have a direct data dependency with an option, there is if/switch-related or loop-related dependency between the option and the operations inside the branches or loop body. We also customized FlowDroid's source manager component to support those systems without standard configuration loading operations. Additionally, we set the depth of alias analysis at five for FlowDorid to balance the taint tracking precision and computational overhead. This is the default value provided by FlowDroid, and the larger the depth the higher the taint tracking overhead required.

#### Characterization and Identification of Performance-Sensitive Options


### Online diagnosis
#### Performance Violation Localization
The goal of this step is to detect the performance-violating hotspot functions based on performance measurements for the selected metrics. 
*DiagConfig* first leverages an off-the-shelf profiler, [Jprofiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/index.html), to continuously monitor the end-to-end performance of a system [in sampled-based mode](https://www.ej-technologies.com/resources/jprofiler/help/doc/main/methodCallRecording.html). When an SLO violation is detected in the end-to-end performance measurement, it collects hotspot functions from the profiler. By [comparing](https://www.ej-technologies.com/resources/jprofiler/help/doc/commandLine/snapshotExecutables.html) the execution time of hotspot functions in the performance violated situation and the normal baseline execution, *DiagConfig* calculates the performance variation of each hotspot function. Most off-the-shelf profilers are capable to measure the execution time of each hotspot function excluding the callee's performance influence. Thus, *DiagConfig* determines that a hotspot function with a significant performance variation is performance-violating. In our paper, we choose the significant variation factor to be 5\%.

#### Cause-effect Chain Building
*DiagConfig* backtracks the call-chains of hotspot functions and analyzes the callsite at the statement/block-level to determine whether there are program-dependencies between the performance-violating hotspot functions and performance-related operations. When a hotspot function in the call-chains involves performance-related operations or is called by the operations, *DiagConfig* correlates the corresponding information-flow paths and the call-chains to construct trackable cause-effect chains (i.e., conditional pairs consisting of information-flow paths and call-chains). 
Associating performance variations of hotspot functions with options corresponding to information-flow paths allows for quantifying and ranking options' importance.
